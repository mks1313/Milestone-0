# My Repository at Campus 42 Barcelona

<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome to my repository at Campus 42 Barcelona! This is where I store my projects and exercises as I learn C and, in the future, C++. Each project represents a significant step in my programming journey.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Libft**
Implementation of the C standard library to strengthen my skills with fundamental functions.

Welcome to my repository at Campus 42 Barcelona! This is where I store my projects and exercises as I learn C and, in the future, C++. Each project represents a significant step in my programming journey. In this section, youâ€™ll find my work on **Libft** and related tasks that help strengthen my understanding of C programming fundamentals.

## Projects

### 1. **Libft**
Development of a personal implementation of the C standard library. This project consists of creating various functions such as `ft_memcpy`, `ft_strlen`, `ft_strdup`, and more to enhance the understanding of low-level operations and memory management.

### 2. **Piscine Tasks**
These are the early projects and exercises I worked on as part of my 42 journey. They include basic tasks that help me develop my coding skills, master fundamental C concepts, and prepare for more complex challenges ahead.
