# My Repository at Campus 42 Barcelona

Welcome to my repository at Campus 42 Barcelona! This is where I store my projects and exercises as I learn C and, in the future, C++. Each project represents a significant step in my programming journey. In this section, youâ€™ll find my work on **Libft** and related tasks that help strengthen my understanding of C programming fundamentals.

## Projects

### 1. **Libft**
Development of a personal implementation of the C standard library. This project consists of creating various functions such as `ft_memcpy`, `ft_strlen`, `ft_strdup`, and more to enhance the understanding of low-level operations and memory management.

### 2. **Piscine Tasks**
These are the early projects and exercises I worked on as part of my 42 journey. They include basic tasks that help me develop my coding skills, master fundamental C concepts, and prepare for more complex challenges ahead.

## My Achievements

- **Programming Languages:** C, and soon C++
- **Key Areas of Knowledge:** Memory management, string manipulation, low-level programming, debugging, and system calls.
- **Additional Skills:** Function development, project management, and learning from mistakes during the "Piscine."
